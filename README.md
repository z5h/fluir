fluir
=========

Dispatcher, router, store helper for React apps.

See a live example [here](http://z5h.github.io/fluir/).

Right now the best way to learn is to read through the example code [here](https://github.com/z5h/fluir/tree/master/example).

Or just look at the implementation. It's only [one file](https://github.com/z5h/fluir/blob/master/index.js).
