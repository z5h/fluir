[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/z5h/fluir.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/z5h/fluir)

##important##
Upgrading to 1.0 will break many things for you.
Sorry.
The good news is I'm using 1.0 for real work. So it's in a more stable/usable state.

##what##

Dispatcher, router, store helper for React apps.

See a live example [here](http://z5h.github.io/fluir/).

##important!##

The API is a bit of a moving target right now and the upcoming [1.0.0 branch](https://github.com/z5h/fluir/tree/1.0.0) contains significant changes.

##install##
```npm install fluir```

Or, if your page already includes reactjs and underscore, you an include [a standalone file](https://github.com/z5h/fluir/tree/master/dist).

##use##

Right now the best way to learn is to read through the example code [here](https://github.com/z5h/fluir/tree/master/example).

Or just look at [the implementation](https://github.com/z5h/fluir/blob/master/index.js).
